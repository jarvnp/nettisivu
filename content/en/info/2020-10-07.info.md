title: About me
HTMLdescription: My website, where I tell a bit about myself and my electronics
  hobby. Also, this site is supposed to be a kind of resume for me.

  <img id=profile-pic src="/img/profile-pic-small.jpg" style="float: left; width: 300px" alt="A picture of me">I am Matias Järvenpää, a Finnish high
  school graduate from Ulvilan Lukio. I graduated in 2020. After high school I
  applied and was accepted to study electrical engineering in Tampere University
  in the Faculty of Information Technology and Communication Sciences. I wanted
  to study electrical engineering because I’ve been interested in electricity
  and electronics for quite a while now. I think it began when as a child I got
  a programmable Lego-robot for Christmas present. From that I gradually moved
  to the Arduino-platform and doing things closer to hardware. That’s the stuff
  I’m still doing. Over the years I think I’ve learned quite a bit about
  electricity, electronics and programming. In 2019 I finished fifth in the
  national programming contest called
  “[Datatähti](http://datatahti.fi/loppu19.html)”. That accomplishment earned me
  a place in most universities in Finland and maybe proves that I don’t totally
  suck at programming. I have also learned quite much about electricity. I might
  even know something beyond the level “electricity is blue and hurts if you
  touch it”. In this website I have tried gathering some information about
  different kinds of projects I’ve done over the years.
