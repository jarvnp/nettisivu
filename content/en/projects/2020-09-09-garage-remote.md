title: Garage remote
description: >-
  At home we store our bikes in our garage. The garage door can be opened either with a key or with a remote. The problem I had with using the key is that it is inconceivably hard work to stop your bike, get off the saddle, get the key from your pocket, open the door and then walk your bike into the garage. A remote would make my life much easier. You can open the doors from a small distance with a press of a button. You don't need to get the keys from your pocket, and you can even drive your bike straight into the garage. Unfortunately we had just one remote, and I couldn't take that just for myself, others needed it too. So I started investigating and reverse-engineering the remote and then tried to make another similar remote that I could attach to my bike. I started the project back in 2016, and I've been tinkering with it still in 2020. This has definitely been a long-time project for me. During this time I've had many moments of great despair and confusion, but sometimes also moments of success.

  I reverse-engineered our garage remote, so that I could easily and quickly open the garage door whenever I want. This has been quite a long-time project for me.

  So it all began back in 2016. I disassembled the remote and started investigating it with an oscilloscope. I found nothing about this device on the internet, so I was on my own. In this case it was good news that the remote-control system is quite old. The components were quite big, and the signal the remote sent wasn't very complicated, so it was quite easy to interpret it even without documentation. Also I guess (and actually kind of hope) that modern remotes have some kind of safety features that make it so that just copying the signal won't get you another working remote.


  I'm not sure if I should write very detailed information about the remote, because it might not be very smart to make a "How to open my garage" -tutorial online. It's quite unlikely that anyone would break into our garage using this website, but I guess I should be careful. So I won't publish all the details of the remote.


  I began with opening the remote and measuring the voltage at the antenna in relation to ground. It was quite easy to see that the remote sends some kind on digital code/password by changing the amplitude of the signal. The circuit on the remote had one IC (integrated circuit), and I managed to find information about that online. Its job was to produce this digital signal. Based on that datasheet and my oscilloscope I already had quite a good picture of what I needed to send out to make the door open. I just needed to find out the signal's frequency. My oscilloscope is the cheapest possible, and its sample rate wasn't enough to tell me the frequency. However the remote had a crystal oscillator on it and its frequency was written on it. I thought that it had to also be the transmission frequency.


  At this point I pretty much knew all I needed to know, and it was time to start making my own remote. I had just one problem. I didn't then really understand how oscillator circuits work. I don't really understand that now either. So I didn't know how to design one which meant that in this project I had to copy the circuit directly from the internet. At first my plan was to make the circuit from parts I already had laying around. I ended up doing some kind of LC-oscillator circuit. Getting the frequency of that just right was a load of work, because, as I said, my oscilloscope was too slow to measure these frequencies. In other words, I was kind of just guessing and hoping to hit the right frequency. I remember sitting on the floor of our garage for hours trying to get the door to open. I had measured my coil's inductance and my capacitors capacitance to be about correct, and I then tried adding other small capacitors of different sizes in parallel with the other to hopefully get the right frequency. Even getting the inductance of the coil about right was hard, because I didn't have anything that could measure inductance. I had made the coil myself by wrapping enameled copper wire around a core of some kind. I put the coil in a circuit where it oscillated with a bigger capacitor, so that the oscillating frequency would be big enough for my oscillator to measure it. The I used the frequency and capacitance values to calculate the inductance of the coil.


  By the way I ordered the same IC the original remote had, and got the digital signal from it that I hoped would open the garage. Only later I realized that it didn't make any sense to order an expensive IC (multiple euros, almost 10â‚¬) when I could have just copied the signal and program a microcontroller to produce the same signal. That's how I did it in the end. The microcontroller I used (Attiny13) was cheaper and also smaller in size and therefore more practical.


  The garage door never opened. I sat hours on the garage floor hoping for something to happen, but no. I actually still don't know what the problem was, because sadly much stuff goes over my head in this project. I am a bit ashamed of that. I still don't quite understand how an oscillator circuit works or how the signal leaves the antenna and how it is received. My goal is that after studying electrical engineering in university I understand these things and can go on with my life when I know how much stupid stuff I've done with this project. Probably the signal frequency was never right. Apparently it should be very precisely correct and "about right" isn't enough.


  At this point I ordered a crystal oscillator online to get the frequency just right. With the crystal I again had to rely on Google and use a circuit I found online, because I didn't know how to design my own. I did try understanding how LC-oscillators and crystal oscillators work but at some point I gave up and thought that someone hopefully explains this to me when I start studying electrical engineering. I soldered the circuit and started testing it with my hopes up. I remember the first moment of success quite clearly. I was in my room, quite far from the garage. I was testing the remote and measuring it with my oscilloscope. Then suddenly my father comes up and asks if I'm making the garage door open and close all the time. That was a great moment. I then made sure that it actually was me opening and closing the door. It felt fantastic to finally be in control of the door. At this point I thought that finishing the project would be easy. Well, it wasn't.


  The problem was that my remote seemed to work only if it was connected to my oscilloscope. So for some reason my oscilloscope was a good antenna for it. Once again my lack of understanding of antennas was a big issue. I know that the antenna must be half the wavelength long, but the wavelength was so large that it wasn't possible to use such long antenna. Also, the oscilloscope's wires aren't that long, so I was confused. I also thought that the oscilloscope's wires shouldn't function as a good antenna, because this could create distortion to its readings. I still don't know why my oscilloscope was such a good antenna. I tried many different length wires as antennas and I also tried connecting coils of different inductance in series with the antenna, because apparently that could make it work, even if the length of the antenna wasn't half the wavelength. As I recall the antenna worked sometimes and occasionally but quite unreliably. The best it worked when I used the bike's frame as an antenna. The garage door then opened almost always. At this point I actually was quite satisfied with my project. After countless moment of pain and despair my remote worked.


  <img id=garage-remote style="float: right; width: 500px" src="/img/garage-remote-small.jpg" alt="The remote attached to my bike in a black box">I used the remote regularly, and it actually was quite handy. However it didn't always work. This annoyed me and I started tinkering it with once again. This time after testing I got to the conclusion that it worked best if my own body were the antenna. So after this I used the antenna so that with one hand I press the power button and with the other hand I hold on the antenna connector. The antenna worked again quite reliably.


  In spring 2020 I got a new bike and I attached my remote to it. (I wasn't able to make the device so small that it would make sense to always carry it with you, so it is attached to the bike all the time.) I decided to do some small adjustments to the device while it wasn't connected to my bike, because it had again been a bit unreliable. Somehow, even though I hadn't done any changes to it, the remote's reliability had weakened over time. This time I started upgrading the device with a bit different style. Because the voltage of the LiPo-battery had never been enough for the remote to work, I had used a small converter to make the voltage a bit bigger. I think I had set the converter's output to about 7-10 volts and thought that was enough. And at first it was enough, since the remote actually worked well at some point. Now as I was frustrated I decided to raise the voltage quite generously. I think now the device works at about 15-20 volts. The emphasis is on the word "works" because the remote actually works now. Raising the voltage might not be very elegant way of fixing the device but now I'm happy with how it works. BTW in the new bike the frame is again the antenna.


  I feel like every text I write here ends with me saying that I'm ashamed of the project but I'm still happy that it works. This text is no exception. The most embarrassing thing is that I still haven't studied how LC-oscillators work. I understand that energy transforms periodically from the magnetic field of the coil to energy in the electric field of the capacitor, but what is unclear to me is how the circuit maintaining this oscillation works. After writing this text I will try to take hold of myself and start studying this mystery.


  I am anyways proud of the fact that I was able to reverse-engineer the remote and was able to make another remote without an online tutorial. The remote is actually pretty handy.
