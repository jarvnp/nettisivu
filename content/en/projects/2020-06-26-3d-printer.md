title: 3D Printer
description: >-
  In spring 2017 I got a cheap 3D printer kit from E-ville. The same product isn't on the market anymore. I had actually been planning on buying a 3D printer for quite a while, and I had spent countless hours watching videos about the subject. I considered myself an expert of the field. Thus building and configuring the printer was a breeze. The device was very much functional and printed well enough.



  At some point I got a "brilliant" idea: I could buy parts for a new printer and print the required plastic parts with my E-ville printer and then I could sell the new printer and make money! Well, that plan didn't quite work out, but I did get myself another functional printer.

  [The printer from E-ville](https://www.e-ville.com/fi/3045300-3d-tulostimet/17637-3d-tulostin-prusa-i3-pohjainen-rakennussarja.html) was a decent machine, but building another printer was also a kind of hobby for me, and I would have been happy if I just broke even by selling it. I don't exactly remember when I started planning on building another printer, but I remember that I started the project quite soon after my E-ville printer was functional. So that would be somewhere around 2017 summer/autumn. Summarized my plan was: All the parts that can't be printed I order from the internet (mostly Ebay). All the necessary plastic parts I 3D-model myself and then print with my old printer. Then I just put the machine together.


  Then I started executing my plan. Things went surprisingly well. A few weeks after ordering the parts our mailbox started filling with mysterious-looking China-packages. And there were quite a lot of them. A total of about 30. For a week every day Posti delivered multiple packages for me, and at the same time there was discussion in the news about how Posti is losing money because people order so much cheap stuff from China. Well... At least I had a good use for the stuff I ordered. There has also been discussion about the reliability of Posti, but I have only good experiences with my orders. Every package I've ever ordered has been delivered, even though the packages often look very shady. (Like a small black garbage bag with something written on it in Chinese and my contact information written somewhere. On the package it's often marked that it contains "GIFT" worth $2. That's why I said the packages looked mysterious.)



  After the parts arrived, I started making the 3D-models and assembling the new printer. I didn't have a manual of any kind, I designed all myself. And still everything was going great. Most of my 3D-models fitted on the first try, and almost all the electronics worked. One part had some kind of problem, but I got a refund and ordered another similar part. Fairly quickly I had a working 3D printer. As you can see on the pictures, on the outside the machine looks quite a lot like the printer from E-ville. That's no coincidence. I used the E-ville printer as an inspiration when designing this printer. The biggest common factor is that the frame is based on 2020 aluminum profiles on both printers. <img id=printer src="/img/printer-small.jpg" width=500px style="float: right;" alt="3D printer">



  I designed one special feature on the new printer: It can print in two colors. I implemented this feature with two extruders on the machine. One of them is bowden and the other direct drive and they both extrude through the same nozzle. As surprising as it is, even this feature is functional, and I was able to print two-colored parts. However, later I did notice that in practice at least I have never had the need to print two-colored parts.  <img id=globe src="/img/globe-small.jpg" width=300px style="float: left;" alt="3D-printer two-colored Earth">



  One day E-ville messaged me and told that the power supply of their printer was dangerous and it should be changed. I don't quite remember had I at this point started building the new printer yet. The message told that the old power supply should be detached and sent to E-ville and then they would send a new power supply as quickly as possible. Unfortunately it would have taken 5-9 weeks. I definitely wouldn't survive that long without a printer, since in addition to normal use I should be using it to print parts for another printer. Luckily we had an old PC laying around at home and it hadn't been used for a long time. So I snatched the power supply of that computer and checked that its 12V line (my printer uses 12 volts) should be powerful enough for my printer. Therefore I plugged it in and sent the old power supply to E-ville. I didn't need a replacement power supply from them, and luckily they offered a possibility to get money back instead of a new power supply. After all this I still had a working 3D printer, it just had a computer power supply, which of course was a perfect fit for the printer after just printing small custom parts that I used to connect the supply with the printer frame. <img id=boat src="/img/boat-small.JPG" width=300px style="float: left;" alt="Blue 3DBenchy">



  At the end I had two working printers. The other I had built and designed from the beginning, and the other was based on E-ville 3D-printer-kit. In addition to changing the power supply I had also modified the E-ville printer by adding an LC-Display and changing the print surface from glass to metal. That change was mandatory, because I broke the original glass sheet. (Pro tip: The prints can get quite strongly stuck to the print surface. Still don't try to detach them with a knife. Use something less dangerous (e.g. a metal spatula), and always face the blade away from yourself. With the knife there are risks, for example maybe theoretically could happen so that the knife slips and you stab yourself in your arm. Then with bad luck you could drop the glass print surface that you were holding. It would obviously break. Don't use a knife.)



  First I put just the new printer for sale. I asked for quite high price, about 500€ I think. Gradually, in the absence of buyers, I lowered the price. At the end I didn't want to go lower that 300€. In my eyes the printer was worth at least that. Probably it also had some emotional value, since it was entirely my design after all. At this point I put the E-ville printer up for sale too. That I valued at 150€. And at the end it was sold for 130€ if I remember correctly. The new printer that I designed is still in my regular use. In hindsight I'm happy that I sold the E-ville printer and not the printer that I had built from scratch. <img id=printer-electronics src="/img/printer-electronics-small.JPG" width=400px style="float: left;" alt="Electronics of the 3D printer (RAMPS 1.4) and a fan">



  I didn't make the software for the 3D printer myself. As are most of the printers on the market, my printer is also based on the open-source-software called [Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/). What I find cool is that the brain of the printer is an Arduino Mega 2560 and that you can compile and install Marlin with Arduino IDE.
