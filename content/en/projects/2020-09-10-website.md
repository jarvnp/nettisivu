title: This website and what kind of stuff I post here
description:
  After high school and before my military service I had some extra time, so I thought it could be good use of my time to put together a website that could be a kind of resume for me, since I don’t yet have real work experience that would correspond with the set of skills I have acquired while doing my own projects. Knowing how to code I would have felt ashamed making the website with some easy-to-use tool, so very soon I found myself confused in the world of HTML, CSS ja JavaScript.

  I made this website partly because I wanted to make myself a resume, but also I wanted to learn the basics of web developing, so I started putting together the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

  I like to do stuff close to hardware. That’s probably why I decided to study electrical engineering. That’s also the reason why I didn’t enjoy developing the website particularly much. Beforehand I had some knowledge about HTML, PHP and CSS, because in high school I took an entrepreneurship course where we started a small business with a couple of my friends. Our company made websites for clients, although in the end we only had one client and we used a website-maker-tool. Still we learned quite a bit about the subject and the website still exists. After the course one of my friends studied the subject further and he actually has a job regarding this field nowadays. [(A link to his website)](https://ktj.st) He guided me in the beginning of this website-project. The HTML and CSS I have coded myself, but he gave me tips and advised me to use Netlify and Hugo and to make my website static so that maintaining the website would be cheap. I must admit that I never understood [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/about/) very well. I had to use Google a lot always when dealing with it. After I had spent some time trying to grasp it and hadn’t made much progress, I decided that it’s not worth it to spend more time here before my website is functional.


  I think that web developing causes me to feel a bit dizzy because we are so far from hardware. For me the important thing is that the site works. At the moment that seems to be the case. If you have a problem with this site, please contact me via the contact information down below. I’m sorry if someone feels dizzy because my code is so horrible to look at. In that case I also hope that you contact me, because I could learn something. I am not proud of all the contraptions I’ve put together and I feel quite ashamed publishing code and information about my projects and the mistakes I’ve done. I never made the projects with the thought in mind that I would some day publish code, images and information about them. You can definitely see that. I haven’t commented my code, so very often it’s very hard to understand what’s going on. What doesn’t make it easier is that the variable names very often don’t make no sense and I haven’t even always been very precise with indentations. Shameful, but I am not going to start fixing my old code.   


  My visual skills are famously bad among my family. That doesn’t make web developing much easier, but I asked frequently others’ opinions about my site and at some point I was happy enough with the basis I had for my site. Then it was time to start writing about my projects. I’m not going to write about everything I’ve done, because I haven’t saved everything and not all projects end up being a working gadget. However, I think that pretty much always when I start planning and developing a project I also finish it, since my plans usually are quite precise. Often I just do some small tinkering that’s not even supposed to be a working gadget. Unfortunately I haven’t documented my projects at all so I have to write everything from memory. All my knowledge about electronics is from the internet so I can’t write formally and I might not know all the terms especially in Finnish. I’m just going to write in casual style about everything that comes to mind about the projects. I haven’t published code anywhere before, but now I will upload my codes to Github and link them here. I have never actually properly used Github before, so I don’t know if I’m using it correctly but at least the codes should be viewable.   


  While writing about the projects I noticed that most of them are made during the years 2016-2018. That means that the last few years I’ve done less stuff regarding electronics. Beginning from the summer 2019 I studied for high school matriculation exams. Because of that I had less time (and motivation) to focus on electronics. Lately I’ve also spent time fixing and improving some projects that have been going on for a long time: My garage remote and bicycle alarm.
