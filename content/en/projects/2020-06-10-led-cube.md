It was made somewhere around late 2016. In the end it's also quite complex contraption. I got the idea for the project from Youtube. A big part of my electronics knowledge is from Youtube. Especially the channel [GreatScott](https://www.youtube.com/user/greatscottlab/featured) has played a big role for me, and that's also where I got the inspiration for this project. The LED-cube is on the background of this website.

Previously mentioned GreatScott had made similar cubes, and he also had a video about [multiplexing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQMUPhyoXoE). He had actually made much bigger cubes (even 8x8x8) and a 5x5x5 cube with RGB-lights. However, I decided that I wasn't going to be that ambitious, so the 64 one-color LEDs of a 4x4x4 cube were enough for me. I had also planned to implement the multiplexing without any external integrated circuits, which also influenced my decision about the number of LEDs. <img id=Led-kuutio-inside1 style="float: right"

  So I began making the multiplexing circuit with NPN and PNP transistors. (2N2222 ja 2N2907 if I remember correctly. I don't think I bought the transistors just this project in mind. I just bought something cheap from Ebay when I started my electronics hobby.) Unfortunately I haven't saved any kind of circuit diagram of the project. So I cracked open the cube and studied a bit about its inner secrets. Based on that and my memories I think I have a pretty good picture about how I implemented the multiplexing: With 4 microcontroller outputs we can connect +5V individually to all the layers of the 4x4x4 cube with PNP-transistors. <img id=Led-kuutio-inside2 src="/img/Led-kuutio-inside2-small.jpg" width="400px" style="float: left" alt="Electronics of the LED-cube: Atmega328p, resistors, transistors and other components"> Every layer has 4x4=16 LEDs, and these are then multiplexed based on rows and columns with NPN transistors. So there is a transistor for every LED, and with 4 microcontroller outputs we can individually turn on the transistors of all the rows. Then with 4 more outputs we can control the 4 columns. In total we need 12 outputs to control the 64 LEDs. I hope that reasonably clear. I put together very quickly some kind of diagram that might make it clearer to someone who is interested. I don't absolutely certainly remember if I made the connections exactly like in the diagram, but the idea is the same. Also somewhere in the circuit there are of course current limiting resistors for the LEDs. <img src="/img/Led-kuutio-circuit.png" width="600px" style="float: right" alt="LED-cube multiplexing circuit diagram">


  The brain of the device is Atmega328P-microcontroller known from the Arduino platform. GreatScott-channel had provided me with instructions to how to use the IC standalone, without the Arduino platform. I remember thinking how lucky I was when I managed to implement the multiplexing with exactly 12 digital outputs, because at the time I thought the Atmega328P only had 12 digital outputs. Sometime later I found out that the analog inputs can be used also as regular digital I/O pins. In this project in addition to the LEDs I used a button, but I connected it to an analog input and thought that I couldn't use that pin as regular digital input. Well, that didn't hurt, it works.



  I remember very little about the programming of the device and I'm too lazy to start studying how my old code works. I programmed a few light shows that can be selected with the button. The device has worked at least so far, even though I definitely haven't optimized its memory usage or even generally made the program very well. I know of at least one annoying flaw the device has: The button doesn't always work properly. Sometimes nothing happens when you press the button and sometimes the device registers multiple pushes even though the user pushes the button just once. I assume the problem would likely be easy to fix, but 4 years ago I clearly wasn't able to do that and I don't think it's worth it to now start fixing my old projects.



  One extra detail: I wanted to power the device from a micro-USB-port so that I could use a cell phone charger as the power source. However at the time I didn't have a micro-usb breakout where I could easily solder wires into. But we had an old phone laying around at home, so I took the micro-usb port from that and somehow was able to solder wires to correct pins on that.



  Making the housing for the device took quite a bit of my time. I did it using some too thick wooden sheet I found in our garage. That's the reason this device is quite heavy.
